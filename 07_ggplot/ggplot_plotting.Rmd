# Introduction to visualizations in R

In this tutorial we will learn the basics of R's capabilities in data visualization. 

R has a basic built in plot feature, but honestly (in my opinion) does not look great and is not worth spending too much time on. I will demonstrate it a little below with a built in R dataset.

To load a built in dataset just type the function `data()` and the data you want to load in from the list
```{r}
data("mtcars")
```

The variables inside the cars dataset include: 

  - mpg = the mpg
  - cyl = number of cylinders
  - disp = displacement
  - hp = gross horsepower
  - drat = rear axle ratio
  - wt = weight
  - qsec = quarter mile time 
  - vs = engine shape V = 0 or Straight = 1
  - am = Transmission type; 0 = auto, 1 = manual
  - gear = number of forward gears
  - carb = number of carburetors

We can see the structure of the dataframe using the `str()` function
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

Lets attempt our first plot using base R. We can do this with the `plot()` function and the argruments `x` and `y` to make a basic scatter plot.
```{r}
plot(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg)
```

We can see that as car weight increases, you get lower mpg. 

There are lots of options for base R plotting. We can change the x and y axes, change fonts, colors, shapes, and write custom legends. We do this with specific options or parameters separated by commas. 

For example. We can add on x and y labels, change the font and change the shapes of the points. 
```{r}
plot(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg,
     xlab = "Car Weight", 
     ylab = "Miles per gallon", 
     font.lab = 6, 
     pch = 20) 
```

This is an ok plot, and this can work. But there are lots of options that can be implimented that may not be super easy in base R plotting. For a more extensive tutorial on base R plotting please see the numerous resources on the internet. An example is [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/base-plotting-in-r-eb365da06b22)

Base R is great, but I really want to teach everyone `ggplot` because it is the most used for visualization, the figures look great, and you can really story tell with data using `ggplot`. 

### `ggplot` basics

Also, there are so many options for `ggplot` and this tutorial is not intended to cover them all. That is too much. It is intended to guide students on the most useful visualizations for their data or the most common types. For extensive options regarding `ggplot` and its use please refer to the ggplot cheat sheet and other internet resources. Remember google can be your friend if you know what you are looking to plot. 

The [ggplot 'cheat sheet'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf) is a downloadable pdf that provides a good summary and quick-reference guide for advanced graphics. Other useful cheat sheets are available here: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

you will need to install the `ggplot2` package if you do not have it installed.

# Load in packages you need
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

For ggplot we will go through the following things

  - basic syntax
  - layers (i.e., geoms)
  - stats
  - position adjustments
  - scales
  - facetting
  - themes

Other things like axes and legend manipulations wont be covered here just for time. Also, we will not get to all the possible geoms and abilities of `ggplot`. The intention is to demonstrate some of the most useful examples for our class population. But again, all things are just a google away 



### Basic syntax

`ggplot` operates by begining a call to `ggplot` using the function `ggplot()`. If you did this you would see an empty plot!
```{r}
ggplot()
```
Whoa! you made a ggplot! 

To plot actual data we need to use what is called aesthetic mappings and tell it where to find the data. We do this by giving the dataframe name and using the `aes()` function within the `ggplot()` function. This is essentially where we put our x and y variables, along with some other things, which we will get to.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg))
```
You should now have a plot with the x and y axes on an empty ggplot. 

### Adding data or layers
The second thing to know about `ggplot` is that it works in *layers*. Just like an onion and just like shrek. 
![shrek](shrek.jpg)

The layers are called `geoms` and you access them by calling the geoms separately and they will appear in order as layers on top of each other. 

### Two continuous numerical variables
For example, lets add points using the geom - `geom_point()`. To do this we need to know another thing about `ggplot` syntax, which is that we use the `+` sign to *add* layers to plots.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

We can add different layers or geoms to the plot. For example, lets add a layer for a trendline. We can do this using the `geom_smooth()`
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```
Notice when we do this there is an overal trend drawn based on the default algorithm for ggplot. 

We can draw the best fitting linear relationship using `geom_smooth()` and adding some extra options into the `geom_smooth()` function. 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) 
```
The option method = lm (Linear Model) tells ggplot to find the best fit linear relatinship. Then the option se = TRUE or FALSE tells whether to draw the 95% confidence interval for predicted values along the best fit line. 

A good example of how the layering works is to now change the order of the geoms in the plot. 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point() 
```
Now the points are in the forfront and the line was drawn in the background. 

I don't like that the x and y axes are not labeled with words so we can change that with the `xlab()` and `ylab()` functions.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Weight") + 
  ylab("Miles per gallon")
```

There... not too bad. This plot looks good enough for a preliminary look at some data. 

#### Scales
But maybe to drive the point home we can put a scale option for point size. We can alter the point size by using the size option in the aes. We can also control specifically which geom we want to alter by putting a new aes argument within geom_point for example.  
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(size = wt)) +
  xlab("Weight") + 
  ylab("Miles per gallon")
```

Or we could do a color scale. When applied to a continuous variable the legend generates a color gradient. But maybe we do not like the color gradient. We can use the `scale_color_gradient()` function to alter the colors and its gradients. 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(color = wt)) +
  xlab("Weight") + 
  ylab("Miles per gallon") +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "forestgreen", high = "black")
```

There are so many other scale options. See them [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#layers)  

Some of the more useful options in my opinion are 
 
  - `scale_x_log10()` or `scale_y_log10()` plots your data on a log 10 scale
  - `scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)` turns your proportion data into a percentage. 

Lets see another example with a categorical type of data. 

### Categorical + Numeric 

This type of combination of data is perfect for visualizing the effects of an ANOVA

Typically, we want to show and compare distributions to know if the mean is different from one treatment to another. 

We show this using many methods. Bars, boxplots, distributions, violin plots, beehive plots, points and lines. The list goes on and on... and R can do it all. Lets demonstrate some of the most useful forms of this type of data visualization. Bars and boxplots. 

For these examples we will use data used in this tutorial come from [Noel et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43705-022-00103-w)

These data contain data from a microbiome project where fungicides were applied to corn and soybean that have been managed under no-till or conventionally tillage. We sequenced the leaf microbiome before fungicides were applied, one week following fungicide application, and one month following fungicides. We also sequenced non-sprayed plots as controls. Then using the sequence data we counted the number of species of fungi in the Bulleribasidiaceae family.

In this dataset we are interested to know if the number of Bulleribasidiaceae species was reduced by the fungicide sprays, and how crop management influenced the disturbance. 

So we have the following variables to express on the plot: 

  - Date Sampled: (i.e., before, one week, and one month after fungicide)
  - Crop: Corn or soybean
  - richness (i.e., number of species) - RESPONSE (Y) VARIABLE
  - Fungicide: Control vs. Fungicide sprayed
  - Treatment or crop management: Conventional, or No-till

#### Read in the data
```{r}
bull.richness <- read.csv("Bull_richness.csv")
```

we will start with the soybean data, so we need to subset the data. 
```{r}
bull.richness.soy.no.till <- bull.richness[bull.richness$Crop == "Soy" & 
                                     bull.richness$Treatment == "No-till",] # subset to soy data
```


#### Boxplots
Now lets plot a boxplot using the `geom_boxplot()` layer.
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness.soy.no.till, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, color = Fungicide)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
```
This is cool. Looks like fungicide had an effect on the richness in collection two and three 

Lets give the plot custom x and y labels
we can do that using `xlab()` and `ylab()`
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness.soy.no.till, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, color = Fungicide)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae richness") 
```

Maybe we want to actually show all of the datapoints to really show the distribution of the data. We can do that using `geom_point()`, which adds points to the plot, then we can tell it we want to "jitter" the points to make a distribution of the points over the boxplot. 
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness.soy.no.till, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, color = Fungicide)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae richness") +
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(dodge.width=0.9)) 
```
So we now introduced a new concept. Position. The position argument helps resolve overlapping layers. Since the `geom_boxplot()` is naturally separated by color (i.e., it is dodged position) we want to place points over the boxplots and jitter their position so we have to use the function `position_jitterdoge()`. 

#### Bar chart.
Lets see the same data in a barchart with standard error bars. A very common way to visualize data. 

For this we can use the *stat* feature of ggplot. The *stat* feature allows us to calculate common summary statistics and plot them from raw data. For example we will use `stat_summary()` to plot the mean and standard error. 
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness.soy.no.till, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, color = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="bar") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar") + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae richness") +
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(dodge.width=0.9)) 
```
Oh... well that doesn't look good. We have to manually tell ggplot to dodge the bars. 

```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness.soy.no.till, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, color = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="bar", position = "dodge") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", position = "dodge") + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae richness")
```
Cool! except why is the color only the outline? Well. some ggplot layers work on *colors* some work on *fill*. So we have to add a fill argument since we are working with both fill geoms and colored geoms.

```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness.soy.no.till, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, color = Fungicide, fill = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="bar", position = "dodge") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", position = "dodge") + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae richness") 
```

#### Lines connecting means

Now, that's not half bad! Except this really is a time series. Also, I want to connect the time points with a line, while still showing the distribution of data. We can do that using the stat_summary function of ggplot just by changing the geom option in stat_summary and adding the group option in the aes function.

```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness.soy.no.till, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, group = Fungicide, color = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="line") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.5) +
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae \n richness") + 
  xlab("") 
```

### Faceting 

Faceting allows you to make separate plots for each subset of your data. For example in the data we are working with we have treatment and crop as other variables in the study. We wouldn't necessarily want to make separate plots for all of them. 

We can access faceting using the function `facet_wrap()`

The syntax of the `facet_wrap()` is a little funky in that we use the `~` "tilda" sign to say what variables we want to facet by. For example. 
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, group = Fungicide, color = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="line") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.5) +
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae \n richness") + 
  xlab("") +
  facet_wrap(~Treatment)
```

Now we can see our data are separated by treatment and that appears as titles above each plot. 
But we still need to add our crop in since now our x axis contains all data for each crop and that's not right. 
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, group = Fungicide, color = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="line") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.5) +
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae \n richness") + 
  xlab("") +
  facet_wrap(~Treatment*Crop)
```
ok still not quite right since we still have all growth stages on the xaxis. 

We can avoid this by setting the option scales = "free"
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, group = Fungicide, color = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="line") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.5) +
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae \n richness") + 
  xlab("") +
  facet_wrap(~Treatment*Crop, scales = "free")
```

Or we can switch the order of the facet depending on which comes first. 
```{r}
ggplot(bull.richness, aes(x = GrowthStage, y = richness, group = Fungicide, color = Fungicide)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom="line") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.5) +
  ylab("Bulleribasidiaceae \n richness") + 
  xlab("") +
  facet_wrap(~Crop*Treatment, scales = "free")
```


So that is a basic tutorial of `ggplot` and its functionalities. There are way more advanced topics which we will explore in the advanced visualizations series.
